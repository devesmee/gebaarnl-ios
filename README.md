# GebaarNL iOS
GebaarNL is an application that teaches people - especially children - the basics of Nederlandse Gebarentaal (Dutch Sign Language). They learn letters and words in sign language while exploring different worlds. The complete version was developed for iOS in Swift.

**Practice level**

For each letter or word, you are required to practice it at least 3 times to be able to continue to a new letter or word. You get immediate feedback about whether what you are signing is correct.

**Mini-game**

Test your knowledge of the letters and words you have practiced before by playing a mini-game. You need to sign a randomized letter or word, once correct you earn a point. You need 10 points within 60 seconds to pass the mini-test and to continue exploring the island. 


**Level test**

Once you have completed all practice levels and mini-games, you are able to play the level test. This test tests your knowledge of the entire level. You need to sign every letter or word once and there is no time limit. The letters or words are randomized.
